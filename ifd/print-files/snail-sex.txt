When both are close enough and touch their genitals, they shoot their love darts. Darts are not fired away but are a contact shot. Usually, the two snails shoot the structures, and they pierce the skin of the other so that they are united. The dangerous thing about this is that sometimes darts can damage an internal organ or go through the body and exit on the other side.

After the snails shoot their “love darts,” copulation follows. The transfer of sperm through the penis may be reciprocal or unilateral; this means that either both transfer it, or just one of the snails. It depends on the species. Others prefer to self-fertilize, so they do not need another individual to lay eggs.
