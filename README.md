# Interplanetary Flirtation Device

The Interplanetary Flirtation Device is a two-way telecommunication system designed for
communicating with extraterrestrial beings. It has been presented in 2018 at [Sister Gallery](https://www.sistergallery.com.au/) (Adelaide, Australia) and [<Interrupted = “Cyfem and
Queer”>](http://interrupted.creamcake.de/) (Berlin, Germany).

In order to contact alien life-forms, human users are required to send messages according to an
experimental haptic stimulation protocol. Users can access the first implementation of this
protocol using a smartphone and a modern webbrowser. The input device for human users is the
underside of a snail's foot. Using a combination of simple or multi-touch gestures, the
Gastropod foot can be manually stimulated in order to communicate.The input is translated into
detailed messages consumable by extraterrestrial users and transmitted via the Interplanetary
Flirtation Device. Responses received from alien life-forms are translated into English and
printed onto paper for human users to read.

During the making of this device I have been thinking about:

- alternate models for sexual and emotional relationships
- visceral bodies entering into and being transformed by virtual spaces
- miscommunicating with strangers
- poetic devices and interfaces designed for fictional scenarios
